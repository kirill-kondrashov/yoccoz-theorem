\textbf{Quadratic family basics (Lyubich I–II notation)}

We set up the quadratic family \texttt{f\_c(z) = z\textasciicircum{}2 + c}, iterates, filled Julia set \texttt{K(c)},
and Julia set \texttt{J(c) = $\partial$K(c)}. We also state (and stub) the standard escape and
compactness lemmas you’ll prove next.
