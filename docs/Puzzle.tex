This module contains the formal definitions and proofs.
\subsection*{DynamicalPuzzlePiece}\label{DynamicalPuzzlePiece}
The dynamical puzzle piece of depth n containing z.
    Definition: The connected component of \texttt{\{z | G(z) < 1/2\textasciicircum{}n\}} containing \texttt{z}.
    These pieces form the basis of the Yoccoz puzzle construction.

\textit{(See code: DynamicalPuzzlePiece)}

\subsection*{PuzzleAnnulus}\label{PuzzleAnnulus}
The annulus between two nested puzzle pieces around the critical point.
    Definition: The annulus between two nested puzzle pieces \texttt{P\_n \textbackslash{} P\_\{n+1\}}.
    The sum of their moduli determines renormalizability.

\textit{(See code: PuzzleAnnulus)}

\subsection*{ParaPuzzlePiece}\label{ParaPuzzlePiece}
A para-puzzle piece in the parameter plane.
    Definition: The set of parameters \texttt{c} for which the critical point 0 lies in the
    dynamical puzzle piece of depth \texttt{n}.

\textit{(See code: ParaPuzzlePiece)}
