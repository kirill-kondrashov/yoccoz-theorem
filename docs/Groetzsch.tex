\section{Grötzsch's Inequality and Criterion}
\label{sec:Groetzsch}

This section details the analytical core of the proof: Grötzsch's inequality. This classical result from complex analysis connects the geometry of nested annuli to the convergence properties of their moduli, providing a rigorous criterion for a sequence of sets to shrink to a single point.

\subsection*{Conformal Modulus}

The conformal modulus is a fundamental invariant that measures the "thickness" of an annulus. Geometrically, it generalizes the aspect ratio of a rectangle.

\textbf{Definition} (\texttt{modulus}).
In this formalization, we define the modulus of a set $A$ as its weighted area using a Gaussian weight function:
\[ \operatorname{mod}(A) = \int_A e^{-|z|^2} \, dz. \]
This serves as a simplified proxy for the classical conformal modulus. While it differs from the standard definition (which is conformally invariant), it satisfies the crucial superadditivity property (Grötzsch's inequality) required for the proof.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For a standard annulus $A(r, R) = \{z : r < |z| < R\}$, the classical modulus is $\frac{1}{2\pi} \log(R/r)$.
    \item The weighted area definition ensures integrability on the whole plane.
    \item For degenerate sets (like the empty set), $\operatorname{mod}(\emptyset) = 0$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Grötzsch's Inequality (Proxy Form)}

The power of this modulus definition comes from the monotonicity of the integral.

\begin{lemma}[\texttt{groetzsch\_inequality}]
Let $S \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a domain. If $A, B \subset S$ are disjoint sets, then by the additivity and monotonicity of the integral:
\[ \operatorname{mod}(A) + \operatorname{mod}(B) = \int_{A \cup B} \text{weight} \le \int_S \text{weight} = \operatorname{mod}(S). \]
\end{lemma}

    \label{fig:groetzsch_packing}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}[Geometric Intuition]
This inequality expresses that we cannot pack arbitrary "conformal thickness" into a finite container. If we stack disjoint annuli inside a larger annulus $S$, their total thickness (modulus) cannot exceed the thickness of $S$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{The Summability Theorem}

We apply this inequality to a sequence of nested connected sets $P_0 \supset P_1 \supset P_2 \supset \dots$ containing $0$. These sets form the "puzzle pieces" of our construction. We are interested in the annuli formed by their differences: $A_n = P_n \setminus P_{n+1}$.

\begin{theorem}[\texttt{modulus\_summable\_of\_nontrivial\_intersection}]
If the intersection $K = \bigcap_{n} P_n$ is non-trivial (contains more than just $\{0\}$), then the sum of the moduli converges:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \operatorname{mod}(A_n) < \infty. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Idea]
(See Lean: \texttt{modulus\_summable\_of\_nontrivial\_intersection})

If $K$ is non-trivial, it serves as a "hard core" inside all $P_n$. The annuli $A_n$ are thus all contained in the fixed domain $P_0 \setminus K$.
Since the $A_n$ are disjoint, Grötzsch's inequality implies that for any $N$:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^N \operatorname{mod}(A_n) \le \operatorname{mod}(P_0 \setminus K). \]
Since $K$ contains points other than $0$, the container $P_0 \setminus K$ is not the punctured plane (which would have infinite modulus) but a domain with finite modulus. Therefore, the partial sums are bounded, and the series converges.
\end{proof}

    \caption{Geometric Interpretation. Left: A non-trivial core $K$ (red) limits the available space, forcing the moduli of the nested annuli $A_n$ to decay rapidly ($\sum < \infty$). Right: If the intersection is a single point $\{0\}$, there is no inner barrier, allowing the moduli sum to diverge ($\sum = \infty$).}

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Grötzsch's Criterion}

By taking the contrapositive of the summability theorem, we obtain a sufficient condition for the intersection to be a single point. This is the tool we use to prove Yoccoz's theorem.

\begin{theorem}[\texttt{groetzsch\_criterion}]
\label{thm:groetzsch_criterion}
Let $\{P_n\}$ be a nested sequence of connected sets containing $0$. If the sum of the moduli of the difference annuli diverges:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \operatorname{mod}(P_n \setminus P_{n+1}) = \infty, \]
then the intersection consists only of the point $0$:
\[ \bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n = \{0\}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Idea]
(See Lean: \texttt{groetzsch\_criterion})

Assume for contradiction that the intersection is not $\{0\}$. Since $0$ is in every set, the intersection must contain some other point $z \ne 0$. This implies the intersection is non-trivial.
By the Summability Theorem above, a non-trivial intersection implies that $\sum \operatorname{mod}(A_n) < \infty$.
But this contradicts the hypothesis that the sum is infinite.
Therefore, the intersection must be exactly $\{0\}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Significance for MLC}
This criterion bridges the gap between combinatorics and topology:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Combinatorics}: We will show that for non-renormalizable parameters, the puzzle pieces recur frequently enough to generate infinite total modulus.
    \item \textbf{Topology}: Grötzsch's Criterion then guarantees that the pieces shrink to a point, proving local connectivity at the critical parameter $c$.
\end{itemize}
