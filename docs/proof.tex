\title{Formalization of Yoccoz's Theorem for Quadratic Polynomials}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
  This document presents a formalization of Yoccoz's Theorem for quadratic polynomials, which is a key step towards the Local Connectivity of the Mandelbrot Set (MLC) conjecture. The formalization is implemented in Lean 4. The Lean 4 code was generated by Gemini 3 Pro Preview with manual fixes and adjustments. It is currently under manual verification; see \url{https://github.com/kirill-kondrashov/mlc/blob/main/README.md} for the latest updates.

\section{Introduction}

The Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of parameters $c \in \mathbb{C}$ for which the orbit of 0 under $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ is bounded. Yoccoz's Theorem asserts that for non-renormalizable parameters, the dynamical puzzle pieces shrink to a point, which implies local connectivity at those parameters.

This formalization covers the proof of Yoccoz's Theorem ("Shrinking Puzzle Pieces") for non-renormalizable parameters.

\section{Context}

The MLC conjecture has stood as one of the most significant open problems in complex dynamics. Yoccoz established the result for non-renormalizable parameters. This work formalizes that result.

\subsection{Disclaimer and Verification}
While this proof has been checked by the Lean 4 kernel, which provides a high degree of assurance regarding the logical consistency of the derivation from the specified axioms, it is essential to emphasize that \textbf{human expert verification is still required}.

The correctness of the result depends entirely on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The faithfulness of the formal definitions (e.g., \texttt{MandelbrotSet}, \texttt{Modulus}, \texttt{PuzzlePiece}) to their standard mathematical counterparts.
    \item The validity of the axioms introduced (e.g., properties of Green's functions, Grötzsch's inequality).
\end{itemize}

        \textbf{Disclaimer}: All content marked as \textbf{Proof} is just a description of a strict proof in Lean which is shown as a listing. It needs multiple readouts as a human and is used primarily to have a gist of the Lean proofs. For some most obvious cases \textbf{Proof} is omitted. Anyways, all Lean listings are accompanied by comments.

\section{Logical Dependencies}

This section describes the logical flow of the proof.

\subsection{The Foundation}
The proof rests on the basic dynamical definitions provided in \texttt{Basic.tex}. The geometric framework is built upon the Green's function (\texttt{Green.tex}, \texttt{GreenLemmas.tex}), which provides a coordinate system for the escaping set. This allows the construction of \textbf{Puzzle Pieces} (\texttt{Puzzle.tex}), which are the fundamental building blocks of the proof.

\subsection{The Analytic Core: Grötzsch's Inequality}
The engine of the proof is \textbf{Grötzsch's Inequality} (\texttt{Groetzsch.tex}). This classical result from complex analysis relates the geometry of nested annuli to the divergence of their moduli.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Criterion}: The theorem \texttt{groetzsch\_criterion} establishes that if the sum of moduli of a sequence of nested annuli diverges, then the intersection of the sets they enclose must be a single point.
    \item \textbf{Role}: This transforms the topological problem ("do puzzle pieces shrink to a point?") into an analytical/combinatorial problem ("do the annuli have enough modulus?").
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Bridge: Yoccoz's Theorem}
\texttt{Yoccoz.tex} connects the puzzle geometry with the Grötzsch criterion.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The theorem \texttt{yoccoz\_theorem} asserts that for non-renormalizable parameters, the combinatorial structure of the puzzle pieces ensures that the annuli formed by differences of pieces have sufficient modulus.
    \item Consequently, the sum of moduli diverges, and by \texttt{groetzsch\_criterion}, the dynamical puzzle pieces shrink to the critical point: $\bigcap D_n(0) = \{0\}$.
\end{itemize}
